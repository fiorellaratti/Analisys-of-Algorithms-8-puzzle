# Analisys-of-Algorithms-8-puzzle
Given the initial state and the goal state of 8-puzzle, use BFS, DFS, and Dijkstra algorithms to solve it.

To compile and execute the code files, an initial and goal state must be provided. The driver document provided in the document, main.py, can be used to try different test cases by changing the "initial" array with any start state.
